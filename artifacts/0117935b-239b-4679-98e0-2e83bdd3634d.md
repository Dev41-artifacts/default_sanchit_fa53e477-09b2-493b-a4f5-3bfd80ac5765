# High-Level Design Artifact

### High-Level System Architecture for E-Commerce Platform for 'Bad Products'

#### 1. **Client-Side (Frontend)**
   - **Technology Stack**: React.js or Angular
   - **Components**:
     - **User Interface (UI)**: Modern, minimalistic design focusing on user experience. Components include:
       - Home Page: Displays featured 'bad products' with search and filter options.
       - Product Page: Detailed view of individual products, including ratings, reviews, and a comparison tool.
       - Shopping Cart: Allows users to review products before checkout.
       - User Account Management: User profiles, order history, and preferences.
     - **State Management**: Use of libraries like Redux (for React) or NgRx (for Angular) to manage application state efficiently.
     - **Routing**: Dynamic navigation between pages and components.

#### 2. **Server-Side (Backend)**
   - **Technology Stack**: Node.js and Express.js
   - **Components**:
     - **RESTful API**: Middleware implementation using Express.js to handle requests from the frontend. Endpoints include:
       - `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of bad products.
       - `GET /products/:id`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific product.
       - `POST /cart`: Add items to the user's shopping cart.
       - `POST /orders`: Process user orders.
     - **Business Logic Layer**: Handle logic for product categorization, user recommendations, and review management.
     - **Authentication**: Implementation of JWT or OAuth for user sessions and data security.

#### 3. **Database**
   - **Technology Stack**: MongoDB
   - **Components**:
     - **Data Models**:
       - **User Model**: Information related to user profiles, preferences, and order histories.
       - **Product Model**: Stores details about products including titles, descriptions, images, low-quality flags, and reviews.
       - **Order Model**: Tracks user orders and related metadata.
     - **Data Retrieval**: NoSQL queries to easily retrieve and manipulate data based on user interactions.

#### 4. **Collaboration and Communication**
   - **Third-Party Integrations**: Utilize services for payment processing (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), email notifications, and review management systems.
   - **Admin Dashboard**: Separate management interface for administrators to monitor product listings, user feedback, and statistical insights.

#### 5. **Hosting and Infrastructure**
   - **Cloud Hosting Providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for deploying both frontend and backend services.
   - **Load Balancers**: To manage incoming traffic and ensure uptime.
   - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: For faster loading times of static assets (images, stylesheets).
   - **Monitoring Tools**: Implement tools such as Google Analytics and server health monitoring services to track performance and user engagement.

#### 6. **Security Measures**
   - **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
   - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - **Regular Audits and Updates**: Ensure dependencies and libraries are regularly updated for security patches.

#### 7. **User-Centric Features**
   - **Review and Rating System**: Allow users to contribute feedback on products.
   - **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest products based on browsing history and user preferences.
   - **Community Features**: Discussion forums or Q&A sections regarding product experiences.

By following this architecture, the platform will be robust, scalable, and capable of delivering a user-friendly experience while meeting the objectives centered around innovation and collaboration in showcasing 'bad products'.
